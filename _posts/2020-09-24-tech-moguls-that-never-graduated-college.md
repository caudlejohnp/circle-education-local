It's been [consistently shown](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereknewton/2018/10/01/college-graduates-are-177-times-more-likely-to-earn-4-million-or-more/#5b90f2a42048) that [college graduates](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/01/12/pay-gap-between-college-grads-and-everyone-else-record/96493348/) are bound [to earn more](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-more-college-graduates-earn-than-non-graduates-in-every-state-2019-5) than [those without degrees](https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/the-college-payoff/).

But at the same time, college [has become more expensive](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-is-college-so-expensive-2018-4) than it's ever been. Student loan debt reached a record high of almost $1.5 trillion at the end of 2018, [according to data from New York's federal reserve bank.](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/hhdc_2018q4.pdf)

The degree-less tale of tech superstars like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates is folklore by this point, but the Facebook and Microsoft founders aren't the only two influential executives who have risen to the top without finishing college. Of the [2017 Forbes ranking](https://www.forbes.com/sites/luisakroll/2017/10/17/forbes-400-2017-americas-richest-people-bill-gates-jeff-bezos-mark-zuckerberg-donald-trump/) of the 400 wealthiest people in America, [17.5% of those on the list](https://visme.co/blog/is-college-worth-it/) --- 70 people --- never graduated from college, according to [analysis from data visualization company Visme](https://visme.co/blog/is-college-worth-it/).

The founders and CEOs of other prestigious tech companies --- including [Twitter](https://www.businessinsider.com/category/twitter), [Fitbit](https://www.businessinsider.com/category/fitbit), [WhatsApp](https://www.businessinsider.com/category/whatsapp), [Tumblr](https://www.businessinsider.com/category/tumblr), and [Square](https://www.businessinsider.com/category/square) --- also forewent higher education to take on the tech world, and their high-stakes bets paid off.

Here are 23 successful executives in tech who never got their college degrees:

Mark Zuckerberg --- cofounder and CEO, Facebook
-----------------------------------

Zuckerberg never did complete either of his two majors (psychology and computer science). He launched "thefacebook.com" while a student at Harvard University, but [he dropped out](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-facebook-was-founded-2010-3) during his sophomore year to move to Palo Alto and work on his company full-time.

Matt Mullenweg --- founder, WordPress

Mullenweg developed the open-source software for blogging platform WordPress as a 19-year-old freshman at the University of Houston, [where he was studying](https://www.houstonpress.com/news/the-blog-age-6574261) philosophy and political science. By the start of his junior year, he left college [for a job at CNET](https://ma.tt/2004/10/press-and-cnet/) in San Francisco.

James Park --- cofounder and CEO, Fitbit

Like many successful tech moguls, Park dropped out of Harvard. [In 1998](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/05/28/fitbits-founders-are-looking-beyond-devices.aspx), he abandoned his [major in computer science](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/223780) to pursue a career as an entrepreneur. [After a brief stint](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/04/01/fitbit-chief-james-park-the-apple-watch-does-too-much-confusing/) as a Morgan Stanley analyst, he started Fitbit in 2007.

John and Patrick Collison --- cofounders, Stripe
----------------------------------------------

![](/assets/uploads/collison-brothers.jpg)

The Collison brothers grew up in Ireland and both [came to Boston for college](https://www.businessinsider.com/stripe-cofounder-john-collison-youngest-self-made-billionaire-2018-6): Patrick Collison at MIT, John Collison at Harvard. They hatched the idea for their first business --- an [online auction management company](http://fortune.com/the-ledger-40-under-40/patrick-and-john-collison-4/) named Auctomatic --- at a local pub, and dropped out of college to build the company's technology in San Francisco.

They sold Auctomatic in 2008 [for $5 million](https://www.cnet.com/news/canadian-media-company-buys-auctomatic-for-5-million/), and became teenage millionaires.

Jack Dorsey --- cofounder and CEO, Twitter and Square
---------------------------------------------------

Dorsey is a two-time college dropout. He [first enrolled at](https://www.stltoday.com/news/native-son-sets-st-louis-atwitter-he-s-always-seen/article_635e1f22-b802-50d4-bc42-29a464ef72ad.html) the University of Missouri-Rolla, but he transferred to NYU after two years. He [reportedly thought of the idea for Twitter](https://www.wired.com/2011/05/the-lost-origin-of-twitter/) while at NYU, where he dropped out a semester short of graduating and moved to the West Coast to work with a tech company.

Daniel Ek --- cofounder and CEO, Spotify

Ek grew up in Sweden, and enrolled in college in 2002 at the country's KTH Royal Institute of Technology to study engineering. He [lasted only eight weeks](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2012/01/04/spotifys-daniel-ek-the-most-important-man-in-music/#7cf824c664ca), when he found out his entire first year would be devoted to theoretical mathematics. He soon started taking gigs at various tech companies.

Larry Ellison --- cofounder, Oracle
---------------------------------

As a kid growing up in Chicago, [Ellison planned to](https://www.businessinsider.com/larry-ellison-shares-what-dropping-out-of-college-and-getting-divorced-taught-him-about-success-2016-5) attend medical school at USC, get married and have kids, and move to Los Angeles working as a doctor. However, that never happened. [He tried getting an undergraduate degree](https://www.businessinsider.com/rise-of-oracle-founder-larry-ellison-2017-1) twice --- once at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (for two years), and again at the University of Chicago (where he lasted only one semester).

After dropping out a second time, Ellison moved to California amid the burgeoning tech scene.

Sean Parker --- cofounder of Napster and former president of Facebook
-------------------------------------------------------------------

As a senior in high school, Parker [was making $80,000 a year](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2011/09/21/sean-parker-agent-of-disruption/#6381d1f57000) through various programming and coding projects. It was enough money for Parker to convince his parents that he didn't have to go to college, and he instead joined up with Shawn Fanning to launch music-sharing website Napster in 1999.

Evan Williams --- cofounder and former CEO, Twitter
-------------------------------------------------

Williams grew up in a small town in Nebraska, and [enrolled for college at the nearby](https://www.omaha.com/money/twitter-co-founder-evan-williams-success-doesn-t-surprise-those/article_5968322b-2c74-5c7a-97b8-414df1a8e413.html) University of Nebraska-Lincoln. However, [he felt college was a "waste of time,"](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/jobs/08bosses.html) and lasted only a year-and-a-half taking as few classes as possible and [without ever declaring a major](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124000817787330413). He then moved to Florida and [bounced around](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124000817787330413) various cities doing freelance work and tech jobs.

Steve Jobs --- cofounder and former CEO, Apple
--------------------------------------------

Jobs attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon, a private university [he once said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/steve-jobs-told-students-stay-hungry-stay-foolish/2011/10/05/gIQA1qVjOL_blog.html?utm_term=.46cd4b49e940) in a commencement speech was "almost as expensive as Stanford." He reportedly dropped out [after one semester](http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/08/25/steve.jobs.profile/index.html), but he stayed in the area and attended classes that interested him. One of those classes was calligraphy, taught by a Trappist monk named Robert Palladino, who [Jobs later credited with](https://www.businessinsider.com/robert-palladino-calligraphy-class-inspired-steve-jobs-2016-3) teaching him about typefaces that he later added to the Mac personal computer he developed.

Jan Koum --- cofounder, WhatsApp
------------------------------

Koum enrolled in San Jose State University [while also working as](https://www.businessinsider.com/whatsapp-ceo-jan-koum-rags-to-riches-2017-5) a security tester at Ernst & Young. While on assignment for EY, Koum was brought on to help out at Yahoo, [where he met](https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/02/19/exclusive-inside-story-how-jan-koum-built-whatsapp-into-facebooks-new-19-billion-baby/#64a125e02fa1) an employee who went on to be his future WhatsApp cofounder, Brian Acton.

Koum switched jobs to become an infrastructure engineer at Yahoo, and was soon inundated with doing work on Yahoo's servers. [Koum](https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/02/19/exclusive-inside-story-how-jan-koum-built-whatsapp-into-facebooks-new-19-billion-baby/#64a125e02fa1) said he "hated school anyway," and dropped out to devote his time to Yahoo.

Moskovitz studied computer science at Harvard, where he was roommates with Mark Zuckerberg. [Moskovitz reportedly volunteered](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-moskovitz-became-facebook-cofounder-2016-3) to help Zuckerberg work on his new website, and learned a coding language in "a couple of days" to be able to work. Along with Zuckerberg, Moskovitz [dropped out](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-facebook-was-founded-2010-3) of Harvard to move to Palo Alto and work on Facebook full-time.

Ferdowsi attended MIT and studied computer science. In the summer of 2007, recent MIT graduate Drew Houston [reached out to Ferdowsi](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/people/alumni/alumni-eecs-connector-2013/dropbox-founders-drew-houston-05-and-arash-ferdowsi) to team up on an idea for cloud storage service that later became Dropbox. Ferdowsi [dropped out of MIT](https://www.inc.com/30under30/2011/profile-drew-houston-and-arash-ferdowsi-founders-dropbox.html) in his last semester to commit himself fully to Dropbox, and worked with Houston out of a small office in Cambridge to build the platform.

As a teenager growing up in London, Branson [struggled with dyslexia](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-fabulous-life-of-sir-richard-branson-2014-6) and did poorly in school. His school's headmaster [once told Branson](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-innovations/richard-branson-and-the-dyslexia-advantage/2012/11/07/67a05b2a-2906-11e2-bab2-eda299503684_story.html?utm_term=.00739bf0c426) that he would either end up in prison or become a millionaire.

As a [15-year-old student](https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/26/news/companies/richard-branson-rebound/index.html) still in secondary school, Branson produced a magazine called Student, and dropped out of school to work on the project. Although the magazine failed, he found success in a side hustle [selling mail-order records](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-fabulous-life-of-sir-richard-branson-2014-6), and turned the business into a successful company called Virgin Records.

Gates [left Harvard in 1975](https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-on-dropping-out-of-harvard-2016-10) to co-found Microsoft with longtime friend Paul Allen.

When Gates left school, he took it as an official leave of absence. Doing that allowed him to return to school ["if things hadn't worked out."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ4G1RtoKyI&t=53)
