-   Designing eye-catching graphics, animations, and other multimedia

-   Learning multiple back-end coding languages

-   Making sure a web page loads quickly so that a visitor doesn't migrate away from it

-   Organizing a website to show up in search engines

-   Ensuring a website can handle high levels of traffic

Moreover, many website developers hone even greater skill sets to become software developers that can design computer and mobile applications. When you learn additional programming languages like Python, Pearl, Scala, or Go, you earn even more.
